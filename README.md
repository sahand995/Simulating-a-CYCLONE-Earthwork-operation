# Simulating a Cyclic Operations Network (CYCLONE) in Unity

I have simulated a CYCLONE in the Simphony Modeling Environment, demonstrating the logical sequences of the different operation scenarios, with the purpose of improving operation's efficiency. 
I have developed this method in Unity, implementing C# programming and VB.NET via Simphony.dll.
