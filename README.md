# Simulating a CYCLONE Earthwork Operation

I have simulated a CYCLONE Earthwork operation in Simphony Modeling Environment software, consisting the logical sequences of different scenarios to gain insights on how to improve the operations efficiency of the operation, and developing it with C# programming and VB via Simphony.dll.

# Assumption

|       #        | Large Truck | Small Truck |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Hauling to Loading Point (minutes)  | 15  | 10 |
| Loading (minutes)  | 10 | 5 |
| Haulind to Dump Site (minutes)  | 30 | 20 |
| Dumping (minutes)  | 5 | 3 |

# Result

* Utilizing 2 Trucks
